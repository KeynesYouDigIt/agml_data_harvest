# AGML Data harvest

### An API for community contributions to AGML

This is a WIP: unless you are looking to contribute to this API specifically, you want to head back to 

https://github.com/Project-AgML
or 
https://github.com/Project-AgML/AgML 

## Quick Start
```
$ poetry install
$ poetry run fastapi dev agml_data_harvest/main.py
```

## Todo

- Actually upload data to the AgML data set instead of printing it and exiting :)

- strategize on preprocessor adding and running process and implement

- deploy
